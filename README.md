## 📚 Learning Methodology

This project follows a structured learning approach inspired by the Henry Bootcamp:

### Daily Routine (Suggested)

1. **Review** (15 min) - Review yesterday's work
2. **Learn** (30 min) - Study new concepts/documentation
3. **Code** (2-3 hours) - Practical implementation
4. **Document** (15 min) - Log learnings and decisions
5. **Commit** (10 min) - Git commit with descriptive message

### Key Principles

- **Incremental Progress**: Build upon previous knowledge
- **Daily Practice**: Code every day, even if just 1 hour
- **Documentation**: Record learnings and architectural decisions
- **Refactoring**: Revisit and improve previous code
- **Testing**: Test what you build
- **Self-Review**: Weekly code review sessions
